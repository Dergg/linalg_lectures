## Previously

See the [concept diagram](https://github.com/stevenaeola/linalg_lectures/blob/48c702f28d3b09d34a072da7d57a5fbd4e7f5cf0/concepts.mmd)

Things in pink we will look at today


## Practical

Choose a question for me to go over

## Area of unit square image

The linear map $f$ on $\Bbb{R}^2$ represented by the matrix

`$$\begin{pmatrix}a & b \\ c & d\end{pmatrix}$$`

Using a graphical argument, find the area covered by the quadrilateral whose corners are

- $f((0,0))$
- $f((1,0)$
- $f((1,1))$
- $f((0,1))$

## Determinant of a 2x2 matrix

Definition and example

Relationship to area


## Determinant of a linear map

Different (equivalent) definitions. 

- linear in columns
- alternating (distinct columns = => det0)
- identity

Assume uniqueness/well-defined (could prove)


## Rationale

- volumes of hypercuboids
- adding blocks


## Properties of determinants

swapping columns gives negative
0 column => 0
linearly dependent columns => 0 (proof?)


## Determinant of diagonal matrix


## Alternative derivation of 2x2 determinant

## Determinant of 3x3

Expand out? Refer to Gilbert Strang video


## Determinant of nxn

Permutation form


## Cofactors

Explanation
example in 3x3


## Transpose matrix

Definition and example


## Determinant of transpose

Equal

Can expand by any row or any column
