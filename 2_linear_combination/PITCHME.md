{{{APPEAR}}}

## Vector space

- Is a mathematical structure: sets, operations, axioms
- Has two sets: scalars and vectors
- Vectors form a commutative group under addition
- Scalars form a field (different kind of addition)
- Scalar multiplication is compatible (like associativity)
- Scalar multiplication is distributive over scalars and vectors
